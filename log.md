# 100 Days Of Code - Log - TylerJustyn.dev

<!-- ### Day 1: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created Pixies webapp to learn touch/mouse events

**Thoughts**: Learned how to track touch/mouse events in the browser, along with some simple ways to detect the type of inputs available. Got some good practice creating gradients, shadows, and animations.

### Day 2: March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a single user PHP blog

**Thoughts**: Built some basic PHP knowledge and got some practice with MySQL. PHP isn't too hard to code in.

### Day 3: March 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Learn-PHP.org

**Thoughts**: *Note: Didn't realize that tutorials were against the rules until I was almost complete, but I do feel like this was really helpful.* It has reminded me that learning Javascript has made it a lot easier for me understand other object oriented languages. I was surprised at how similar writing PHP feels to writing Javascript, at least at a basic level.

### Day 4: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project called sentence-generator

**Thoughts**: This was just a fun project idea I found in one of the many lists on Reddit that's simple, but has a lot of room for advancements. I didn't have a lot of time to code today, but I wanted to make sure I got to at least code something before the day was done.

### Day 5: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added a hover effect to each letter in Pixies

**Thoughts**: Got some more practice in CSS transitions and targetting individual parts (characters) of elements using Javascript.

### Day 6: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed a Hackerrank Assessment

**Thoughts**: Realizing that I could use some more practice solving these types of challenges to strengthen my problem solving abilities. Planning to do more.

### Day 7: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Hackerrank Interview Preperation Kit (Warm-up Challenges: Sock Merchant)

**Thoughts**: Struggling with this one, but taking it one step at a time. In practice, I do well at making my code work, but when it comes to challenges like this, I struggle. It motivates me to practice because I know in the end it will make me a better coder.

### Day 8: March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Hackerrank Interview Preperation Kit (Warm-up Challenges: Sock Merchant)

**Thoughts**: Still struggling with this one. I've gotten my solution to pass 3 tests, but still failing the other 6 and I'm not sure why. Not giving up though!
